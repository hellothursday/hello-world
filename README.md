# hello-world
My first ever repository.
Laura here! I am very new to coding, other than the ~cool~ fansites I used to make back in school. Looking forward to making lots of exciting things! Other things I like to do: make zines, play guitar, go to gigss, read comics, knit and play point and click adventure games.
